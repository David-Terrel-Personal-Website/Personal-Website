        <p>I have been around MMA since I was a baby. I grew up watching the best fighters of all different styles
            fighting and watching how different styles matched up.
            I learned to love the sport early on growing up in gyms seeing the fighters that I would watch fight on TV.
        </p>
        <p>As I got older I started to learn the skills of a fighter and developed my wrestling as a early teen.
            Then I developed my boxing skills in my late teens and early 20s, and started trainging with a amatuer MMA
            team.</p>
        <p>At 22 I focused purely on jiu jitsu for a year and won a few medals at tournaments in the blue belt division,
            and earned my purple belt.
            I am now 23 still focusing on Jiu jitsu, and plan on joining the pro team in my city at one of the best gyms
            in the world.</p>
        <p>There is a lot more on my journey in MMA, I have enjoyed how much ive learned and look forward to what i will
            learn and accomplish.</p>

        <h2>Brazillian Jiu Jitsu</h2>
        <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/688499898/photo/two-young-males-practicing-judo-together.jpg?s=612x612&w=is&k=20&c=q-4Vv4l_zib3S3qgnlJ9idg76b6cYmFGkROPiH5krvQ="
            alt="Brazillian Jiu Jitsu" alt="MMA" class="images float_right" />
        <p>My first sport ever was brazillian jiu jitsu, I competed on and off throughout my childhood. Id say most of
            my discipline comes from my years of grappling as a kid. Jiu jitsu is a physical sport but also in my
            opinion the most technical.
        </p>
        <p>I would compare jiu jitsu to chess. I would say Jiu jitsu is actually even more technical than chess, because
            there is more factors that come into play, like body type,grappling style,strength,cardio, and most importnt
            skill. </p>
        <p>Doing jiu jitsu as a kid helped me transition to and excell at wrestling in highschool in my early teens .
        </p>
        <p>Both of those sports together has made my grappling high level. I have just started tapping out black belts
            in the past year. My goal is to win a world championship in jiu jitsu.</p>

        <h2>Creating</h2>

            alt="Creating" alt="MMA" class="images float_left" />
        <p>This is not a specific hobby, but a generalized hobby. I feel to reach the highest level of happiness, one
            must create to leave things behind for the world after they have left this earth.
        </p>
        <p>The more meaningful things somebody can create the bigger their impact is they left for the world. Some of my
            favorite creators are Virgil Abloh, Pharrell Williams, and Napoleon Hill.</p>
        <p>I like trying all sorts of new hobbies and creating different things, because I am still finding things I am
            interested in to this day.</p>
        <p>I also like enjoying what other people have created, like great movies, music, clothes, art, architecture,
            cars. I
            enjoy seeing how others express themself by the great things they design.</p>
